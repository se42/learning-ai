# Phase 0 Reflections

This phase was all about getting to know the landscape of AI and the tools available to me.
My main project for Phase 0 was reading [AI Engineering](https://a.co/d/6bwEJ1h) by Chip Huyen.
I should have kept a journal of my thoughts as I progressed through each chapter, but I didn't.
Now that I've finished reading it, below are my retrospective thoughts on the parts I'm still
thinking about and am most interested in building on going forward.
