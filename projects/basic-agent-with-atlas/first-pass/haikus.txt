What would you like to ask the guests? Write a haiku describing yourself.

Socrates

Wandering questions,  
Seeking truth in every word,  
Wisdom’s silent light.

====================================

Marcus

Quiet strength within,  
Journeys of the mind unfold,  
Virtue guides my path.  

====================================

Tyrion

In shadowed halls dwell,  
Wit sharper than any sword,  
A lion, yet small.

====================================

Ruth

Injustice stands tall,  
A quiet voice for the weak,  
Justice blooms in time.

====================================

Hannah

Thoughts weave through the air,  
Truth dances in shadows cast,  
Moral gaze unfolds.

====================================

Søren

Inward winds whisper,  
Paradox, faith, solitude—  
Seeking the true self.

====================================
