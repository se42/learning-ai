# learning-ai

Monorepo for my AI learning journey.

## Project Purpose

I have a lot to learn! This repository will serve as my hub for tracking my progress--for
both academic learning and practical application.

## Iterative Approach

Learning AI will require me to "learn to know" and "learn to do". My personality pulls me
towards learning to know first, but as an engineer I understand that practical value comes
from doing and making. As such, my approach will be to alternate between knowing and doing,
and to repeat this process as I progress through my learning journey.

    Learn to Know => Learn to Do => Reflect => Survey & Raise the Bar

Furthermore, in each iteration of this process I will touch on the following tracks:

- Math & Theory
- Model Architecture
- Application Development
- Cloud Operations
- Hardware & Performance

This approach will allow me to lean into my desire to build a broad base of knowledge while
also developing practical skills at every layer of the AI technology stack.

## Learning Log

### Phase 0

Phase 0 was mostly about getting my bearings. I read [AI Engineering](https://a.co/d/6bwEJ1h) by Chip Huyen, watched a ton of YouTube videos, perused the LangChain docs, ordered multiple
books, and saved even more for future reading. I also developed this framework to aid my
learning journey. Most importantly, I ignited my curiosity.

As I leave Phase 0, there are five main categories of knowledge I'd like to continue building
on. Here are a few of the burning questions I have for each that will inform my next phases:

- **Math & Theory**: TBD
- **Model Architecture**: TBD
- **Application Development**: TBD
- **Cloud Operations**: TBD
- **Hardware & Performance**: TBD

My full Phase 0 reflection is available [here](reflections/phase-0.md).
